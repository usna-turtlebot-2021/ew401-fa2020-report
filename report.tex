\section{1. Introduction}

\subsection{1.1. Customer Interview}
Our customer is Dr. William Sandberg, who is currently a professor at George Mason University and a maritime research specialist. He works with RDSA and has experience in foils and fins as they relate to our project. Depending on the success of our project, one of his potential plans for our product is to forward the design to government contractors for further development or research purposes. He will also potentially use this in his own research or instruction. The highlights from our interview include the matriculation and application our project will have, the difficulty of waterproofing, the material of the fins and outer body, an advised timeline, and greater insight on the movement of the fins. We found that these types of projects are the foundation of work much later that sees real application and use. Waterproofing came up as a serious risk in terms of the design feasibility of our project, we came to the conclusion modularity needs to take priority in our design to combat the difficulty of waterproofing. We found that through our consultation the opportunities for design are not limited due to the resources at our disposal to create inexperienced materials/ components for our project. We came to the conclusion that in order to effectively design our bot we need to structure the design process to effectively incorporate modularity and a process of feedback. Finally we were advised on various prevalent research that will be useful in our design of our finned bot. Our point of view statement is: A mission platform conducting surface or undersea operations needs to be able to maneuver a deployed UAV accurately at low speeds in order to recover them in a way that is much safer and cost-effective than the current means. 

\subsection{1.2. Additional Background Research}
Historically autonomous underwater vehicles have followed commonly accepted forms of propulsion, to include conventional propeller controlled UUVs. These systems have limitations in their mission scope due to capabilities they possess to include lack of low speed maneuverability and inherent limitation of these vehicles to transition from the aquatic environment to that of the terrestrial. These lack of features in conventional robotic systems present a need for significant advancement of technology and design of UUVs. Researchers can turn towards living organisms for inspiration to design energy efficient propulsion systems with high maneuverability and amphibious capabilities, 550 million years of evolution has given us numerous sources to draw ideas from. As Dr. Stephen Carl Licht a researcher at MIT put it “To push the operating range of underwater vehicles, particularly small autonomous robots, into these chaotic margins we must close the performance gap between nature and machine” Many organisms to include; sea turtles, seals and penguins for example all have amphibious capabilities and low speed maneuverability each however has achieved this capability with its own unique design. Our research presents three projects which will explore the idea of drawing on nature as a resource in the design and advancement of technology of UUVs. 

The first project explored biomimetic oscillating foil propulsion to enhance underwater vehicle agility and maneuverability. The Licht Turtlebot, designed by MIT researcher Dr. Stephen Carl Licht and his team designed an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) inspired by the swimming abilities of sea turtles powered by four fins. Through the use of biometric actuation this project has improved the maneuverability of AUVs, particularly in its ability to both maneuver at cruising speeds and remain agile at lower speeds. The 2nd project explored system integration and fin trajectory design for a robotic sea-turtle. The Naro-Tartaruga bot team designed a robotic platform which utilizes fin propulsion actuators that imitate a sea-turtle while implementing basic concepts of control for fin locomotion. As described by the Naro-Tartaruga bot team this project's motivation was “the fluent and aesthetic locomotion of marine animals... Flexibility, agility, efficiency, high speeds, and endurance are some of the main attributes that can be used to describe fin-locomotion concepts.” The 3rd project explored flipper-driven terrestrial locomotion of a sea turtle-inspired robot. The Flipper Bot team through the study of hatchling sea turtles design a robotic platform to mimic the territorial based locomotion of hatchling sea turtles.  As described by the FlipperBot team this project's motivation was “To discover principles of flipper-based terrestrial locomotion we study the mechanics of a hatchling sea turtle-inspired robot [1]” The purpose of each of these projects was to further the technology and design of amphibious vehicles through the study of nature.

\section{2. Problem Statement}
\subsection{2.1. Problem Statement}
To develop and design an amphibious vehicle that is able to accurately maneuver at low speeds in still water, crawl in a variety of water depths, and transition  from the locomotion of swimming to crawling seamlessly utilizing locomotion of sea turtles as inspiration.
\subsection{2.2. Functions}
Our functionality requirements, in hierarchical order, are as follows: must be able to move forward in the water, must be able to turn left and right in the water, must be able to move forward on land, must be able to turn left and right on land, and must be able to crab left and right in the water.
\subsection{2.3. Constraints}
Our robot needs to operate under a certain power threshold – the quantity is yet to be determined. Our robot also must withstand up to 15 feet of water pressure. Our robot needs to fit within certain dimensions to help the design process and functionality. Additionally, our robot needs to operate regularly with zero mechanical failures.

\section{3. Related Work}
The Licht Turtlebot \cite{licht2008biomimetic}, designed by MIT researcher Dr. Stephen Carl Licht, features biometric oscillating foil propulsion to enhance underwater vehicle agility and maneuverability. The robot has numerous features we hope to emulate, as well as shortcomings to improve upon. Its strengths include: Highly agile at low speeds, highly maneuverable at cruising speeds, and it is built for swimming and very high performing in that category. Its weaknesses are: The actuators do not allow for travel on land, it does not have enough degrees of freedom for our movement, and its large scale requires more power and manpower to operate. 

The Naro Tartaruga Bot \cite{siegenthaler2013system} is another related project. This turtlebot consists of four flapping foils, two pectoral fins and two rear fins, and eight sensors, to include a pressure sensor, temperature sensor, GPS, gyro, compass, encoders, and water leakage/flow sensors. The fins have three degrees of freedom, allowing for greater mobility and maneuverability. Its strengths include that it will very closely resemble the locomotion of a Sea Turtle, which is our end goal. It will also provide unique means of maneuvering that may prove much more agile, efficient, and smooth. Its main weakness is having different size fins with irregular shapes may pose a problem with creating the optimal speed and sweeping angles to achieve the proper movement patterns.

The Flipperbot \cite{mazouchova2013flipper} is a two-limbed robot operated by dual servo motors connected to a hull-mounted bending shoulder mechanism. It was designed to test flipper-based terrestrial locomotion. Its strengths include a simple mechanical design and its proven example for sustained travel on land. However, it is unable to efficiently travel in water like other models. 

The purpose of each of these projects was to further the technology and design of amphibious vehicles through the study of nature. Our robot design needs swimming capabilities, terrestrial locomotion with flippers, and proper system integration and fin trajectory. Collectively, these projects provide examples of all our necessary features. 

\section{4. Conceptual Designs}
\subsection{4.1. Design Concept 1:} 
Inner mechanics - There will be only a microprocessor and sensors to include an IMU.  As communications and power will be achieved through the use of tethering. 

Fins - Will be unique in form in comparison per set of pectoral and lower fins, they will be constructed of a semi-stiff composite plastic. They will be larger in comparison to the scale depicted in the drawing to the left. 

Outer body - Will be constructed of stiff composite plastic that will add buoyancy if needed, another layer of waterporectection, and make the turtlebot have less hydrodynamic drag. 

Shoulder mechanism - Composed of two servo motors connected to a dc motor contained in a stationary. This will allow the front flippers to both be able to properly replicate the locomotive  gait of the pectoral fins of sea turtle swimming while also enabling the flippers to aid in crawling .

Leg mechanism - Composed of three servo motors connected in conjunction to the body of turtle bot. The three servos will allow these flippers to aid in providing thrust for swimming and enable the locomotive terrestrial gait of sea turtles.

\section{Formatting and Style Guidelines}
Appendices are optional and should appear at the end. You may have several appendices if necessary, to include computer programs, large data sets, or detailed drawings. Be sure to note the existence of any appendices or enclosures within the relevant portion of the report text.  

This appendix provides stylistic guidelines. % and MSWord tips on creating linked and cross referenced documents. Fuck MSWord 

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}
Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, sc, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Units}
The use of SI units is encouraged. English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as “3.5-inch disk drive”. Use a zero before decimal points: “0.25”, not “.25”. Use “cm3”, not “cc”.
 
\subsection{Equations}
Number equations consecutively. Equation numbers, within parentheses, are to position flush right, as in (2). Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a sentence, as in
%		α  + β  = χ.					        (2)
Note that the equation is centered. Be sure that the symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following the equation. Use “(2)”, not “Eq. (2)” or “equation (2)”, except at the beginning of a sentence: “Equation (2) is . . .”

\subsection{Figures and Tables}
Place figures and tables at the top and bottom of pages. Avoid placing them in the middle of pages. Figure captions should be below the figures as shown in Figure 6; table captions should appear above the tables as shown Table 1. To insert captions select from the MS Word toolbar References/Insert Caption.  Reference the figure in the text by choosing the Insert tab and selecting Cross-reference from the Links sub-tab.  Choose the reference type that you want and be sure to select the appropriate entry in the Insert reference to pull-down list.  This will only work if you have used Insert Caption with the figure or table. This can be achieved by right-clicking on the item or from the References Menu.

Axis Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for axis label or titles. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity “Magnetization”, or “Magnetization, M”, not just “M”. If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write “Magnetization (A/m)” or “Magnetization {A[m(1)]}”, not just “A/m”. 

\subsection{References}
Fuck Word. Use Bibtex. 
%Note that, while Word includes many bibliography-building tools, one of the easiest methods to build a lengthy reference list is to move to the end of your document and start a new list of references formatted as follows:
%1)  Click on the HOME tab at the top of the Word window
%2)  In the Paragraph sub-window, click on the down arrow next to the numbered list layout.
%3)  Click on the format that shows [#], OR, if that format is not available, select “Define New Number Format” from the bottom of the pop-up window.
%4)  If you had to define a new number format, select the “Number style” as “1, 2, 3, …” and change the “Number format” to [1] by typing the [ and the ] around the 1, and removing any other punctuation, as shown at right.  Select OK when done.
%5)  Type entries onto the list.  It will automatically update.
