## Advisor comments to the team
The team made good progress and is working in tandem with the honors fish guys and 2/C Smith. I would have liked to have seen us do more with hardware including sketch models, foam, foamboard, cardboard models, 3D prints or lasercuts, and tetrix kit work but we were prevented. The guys felt so strongly about this that I purchased Actobotix kit materials out of pocket to make a fin wiggler with them. EW401 is failing to provide the design experiences these guys need. 

The report in its current state is incomplete and has bits from the template. I actually applaud the guys for focusing on making stuff rather than formatting a template. 

I have been working on transferring your report to Latex and Github to allow collaborative editing. It would help immensely if you can provide your original figures as their native file formats. I will also direct, moving forward, that you do not use any templates or rubrics provided by other professors without discussing with me first. 

Minor comments will be handled via the Latex / Github repository. I would have also asked you to include a disclaimer on the fake labor and overhead numbers which are done only for EW401 training purposes and should never be passed along to a sponsor without a disclaimer. 

There are many extra items the team did (fin wiggler, Matlab models, turtle shoulder girdle OpenSim model) that are not discussed!

## Advisor comments about EW401
I do not fault the guys for this, but I believe the way EW401 is conducted sets teams up to fail. At other universities (e.g. MIT 2.007, MIT 2.008, and MIT 2.009) the charts and tools are taught within the first few weeks of the sophomore design class (2.007) without much ado. Here they are dragged out, distracting students from actually getting their designs done. These guys needed to be wagging fins and trying stuff in August but could not, partially due to covid, but also in large part due to the design of EW401. 

The format also unacceptably places the 401 instructor and course coordinator and a single customer in the prime position of shaping what the team does. As a result, I have less ability to guide them in the early phases of their project than others, even though ultimately I am the one who will have to help them finish and grade them at the end of capstone EW404. 

The class focus on designing a single widget is a poor fit for other things the student may have to design. I have been outspoken about this in the context of scientific research. An output of their work may be algorithms and understanding / answers to questions about functional morphology of swimming with fins but 401 provides no room for these. I was able to lead undergraduate teams to publications at MIT/Harvard, Berkeley, and UNC but the way things work here precludes this with my otherwise capable capstone teams. 

The rubrics and templates warp their thinking and should be eliminated. There is a ridiculous 6 page rubric this year - it seeems to grow by a page each year. If I tried to evaluate technical work at Naval Reactors using the course coordinator's 6 page rubric, my section head and ADM Bowman would have thrown a desk across the room. This department does not appreciate how real Navy acquisition professionals work (e.g. Naval Reactors, or the wider Naval Sea Systems Command) but their methods work. When they rename the building for a WRCE prof I will be happy to switch over but last I checked it's still Rickover Hall. 
  * Two "problem statement" headings
  * All criteria graded 0-4 with no actual test data or raw numerics
  * Sketches only because we pushed really hard
  * Though their title includes "Comparative Biomechanics" there was no room for them to consider the relationship of their project to other organisms that swim, nor place to justify use of turtles as bioinspiration - because it's not in the stupid rubric. 
  * Fake numbers in budget directed by rubric and templates
  * WBS hours never tied to budget
  * During design presentations, blind use of an example presentation (even including nicknames for team members just because a team did that before)
  
I understand the need to learn the thought process used by engineers to do design work, but the emphasis here is solely on PROCESS and any THOUGHT is generally accidental.
